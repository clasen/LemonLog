## 🚀 Getting Started 

1. **Install LemonLog**

   ```bash
   npm install lemonlog
   ```

2. **Usage**

   First, require and create a new instance of LemonLog in your project:

   ```javascript
   const log = require('lemonlog')('MyApp');
   ```

   Then, log away:

   ```javascript
   log.info('This is an info message!');
   log.debug('Here’s something you might find interesting...', { emoji: 🎁 });
   log.inspect('Inspecting a deeply nested object', { a: { b: { c: { d: 1 } } } });
   log.warn('Warning! Warning! 🚨');
   log.error('Oops! Something went wrong. 🔥');

   ```

   Use DEBUG to filter logs:
   
   ```bash
   $ DEBUG=* node demo/demo.js
   myApp:info ------ This is an info message { a: 1 } +0ms
   myApp:debug ----- This is a debug message +0ms
   myApp:inspect --- [
   myApp:inspect ---   'This is a full json depth inspect message',
   myApp:inspect ---   {
   myApp:inspect ---     a: { b: { c: { d: 1 } } }
   myApp:inspect ---   }
   myApp:inspect --- ] +0ms
   myApp:warn ------ This is a warning +0ms
   myApp:error ----- This is an error +0ms
   myApp:debug ----- [ 'Custom success message' ]
   myApp:debug ----- { return: 'ok' } +0ms
   myApp:error ----- { return: 'error' }
   myApp:error ----- [ 'Custom error message' ]
   myApp:error ----- null +0ms
   myApp:debug ----- Success: { return: 'ok' } +1ms
   myApp:error ----- { return: 'error' }
   myApp:error ----- null +1ms

   $ DEBUG=myApp:error* node demo/demo.js
   myApp:error ----- This is an error +0ms
   myApp:error ----- { return: 'error' }
   myApp:error ----- [ 'Custom error message' ]
   myApp:error ----- null +0ms
   myApp:error ----- { return: 'error' }
   myApp:error ----- null +1ms
   ```

3. **Customize Your Callbacks**

   Handle logs with your own custom logic:

   ```javascript
   async function someAsyncFunction(fail, cbk) {

      if (fail) {
         cbk({ return: "error" }, null);
      } else {
         cbk(null, { return: "ok" });
      }
   }

   // Custom callback example
   someAsyncFunction(false, log.callback("Custom success message"));

   someAsyncFunction(true, log.callback("Custom error message"));


   // Exec example
   someAsyncFunction(false, log.exec(result => {
      log.debug('Success:', result);
   }));

   someAsyncFunction(true, log.exec(result => {
      log.debug('Error:', result);
   }));

   ```
