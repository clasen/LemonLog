## üöÄ Getting Started 

1. **Install LemonLog**

   ```bash
   npm install lemonlog
   ```

2. **Usage**

   First, require and create a new instance of LemonLog in your project:

   ```javascript
   const LemonLog = require('lemonlog');
   const log = new LemonLog('MyApp');
   ```

   Then, log away:

   ```javascript
   log.info('This is an info message!');
   log.debug('Here‚Äôs something you might find interesting...');
   log.warn('Warning! Warning! ‚ö†Ô∏è');
   log.error('Oops! Something went wrong. üö®');
   ```

3. **Customize Your Callbacks**

   Handle logs with your own custom logic:

   ```javascript
   async function someAsyncFunction(fail, cbk) {

      if (fail) {
         cbk({ return: "error" }, null);
      } else {
         cbk(null, { return: "ok" });
      }
   }

   // Custom callback example
   someAsyncFunction(false, log.callback("Custom success message"));

   someAsyncFunction(true, log.callback("Custom error message"));


   // Exec example
   someAsyncFunction(false, log.exec(result => {
      log.debug('Success:', result);
   }));

   someAsyncFunction(true, log.exec(result => {
      log.debug('Error:', result);
   }));

   ```
